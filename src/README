exp.zip contains all files.

----------

Run flex, bison, and compile by writing the following on the command line:

  make -f Makefile

To run, write the following on the command line:

  ./exp

Now you can type an expression ended by $ and <Ctrl>-D.
Example (leaving out the <Ctrl>-D):

  3*4-1/x$


To run the Test files simply pipe them via stdin.

  ./exp < inputB.txt

To run with extra debug information, -d must be passed in as parameter.
  
  ./exp -d
  or 
  ./exp -d < inputB.txt

Included test files are inputA.txt and inputB.txt
